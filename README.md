- **Orders**: Number of orders made
- **Amount**: Sales amount
- **Status**: Status of the order
- **Unnamed1**: Additional column (if available)

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution, data visualization, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Import the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine the dataset to understand its structure, generate summary statistics, and derive initial insights.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and pie charts to illustrate sales trends, popular products, and other relevant patterns.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarize the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Files Included

- `diwali_sales_data.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis.
- `diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diwali-sales-analysis.git
    cd diwali-sales-analysis
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
3. Open `diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis step-by-step.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Diwali sales data reveals valuable insights into sales trends, popular products, and customer behavior during the Diwali period. These findings can inform strategic decision-making, marketing planning, and further business analysis.
